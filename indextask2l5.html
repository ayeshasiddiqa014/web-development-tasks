        <p>The first official Alumni body of COMSATS Islamabad is dedicated to keeping you connected with your campus
            and fellow CUI-Islamabad alumni, regardless of where you are in the world. The COMSATS-Islamabad Alumni,
            comprising graduates from all academic programs at CUI-Islamabad, forms an integral part of the University.
            This ever-expanding body represents a rich resource base for the campus with its vast reservoir of diverse
            talents and expertise spanning areas like Computer Sciences, Management, Engineering, and Mathematics.
            Through this alumni body, the campus ensures a strong communication link is established amongst the alumni
            and between the alumni and the campus. To achieve this, it has established an office where administrative
            facilities are provided to its alumni for the completion of their membership. This office is responsible for
            building a cohesive network of CUI-Islamabad Alumni. It ensures unhindered communication throughout the year
            that includes timely announcement of all CUI campuses events. The office aims to organize various
            alumni-based activities that will help connect the alumni around the globe. These measures keep our alumni
            informed about the whereabouts and achievements of fellow alumni, as well as important developments at the
            campus. An electronic version of the campus Magazine will also be available on the website.</p>
